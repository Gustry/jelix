# Changes into Jelix 2.0

- minimum PHP version is 8.1.0

- Many Jelix classes are now under a namespace, but some classes with old names
  still exist to ease the transition, although it is recommended to use new name
  as these old classes are deprecated.

- `jApp::coord()` is replaced by `\Jelix\Core\App::router()`

- The `charset` configuration property is deprecated. Everything in Jelix works
  with the UTF-8 charset from now. Locales must be only in UTF-8.

- new `var/build` directory used to store files generated by the installer.
- Some files are not compiled anymore on the fly, but only during installation.
  It avoids to launch compilers during an http request, to improve performance.
  During the development, you can set a file watcher (into your IDE for example)
  that will call `php dev.php compile $FULLPATH_OF_FILE`, to compile a single
  file without calling the installer before each test into your browser.
  Files that are compiled during installers:
  - locales files (properties files)


- configuration parameter to activate modules are moved from the main 
  configuration to framework.ini.php.

- project.xml can be replaced by a json file named jelix-app.json
- module.xml can be replaced by a json file named jelix-module.json

- module.xml: 'creator' and 'contributor' elements changed to 'author'
- module.xml: 'minversion' and 'maxversion' are changed to 'version'
    Same syntax in this new attribute as in composer.json

- Remove support of infoIDSuffix from jelix-scripts.ini files

- Functions declared into the namespace `Jelix\Utilities` are now into the namespace `Jelix\Core\Utilities`

- the script runtests.php and the unit test mechanism for modules
  (tests inside modules) are now gone. See upgrade instructions.
- the modules jacl and jacldb are not provided anymore. Use jacl2 and jacl2db instead.

- remove support of the deprecated command line scripts system of Jelix <=1.6. Only Symphony console scripts are supported from now.

- remove the deprecated jforms builder based on `jFormsBuilderBase` and `jFormsBuilderHtml`
  and so, builders named `legacy.html` or `legacy.htmllight`
- remove binding feature from jClasses

## changes in jDb

jDb is now relying on [JelixDatabase](https://github.com/jelix/JelixDatabase).
The `jDb` class is still existing, but most of internal classes of jDb
are gone and replaced by classes of JelixDatabase:

- `jDbConnection` and `jDbPDOConnection` are replaced by objects implementing `Jelix\Database\ConnectionInterface`

  `jDbColumn`, `jDbTable` are replaced by some classes of the `Jelix\Database\Schema\` namespace.
- `jDbUtils::getTools()` is deprecated and is replaced by `\Jelix\Database\Connection::getTools()` 
- `jDbWidget` is deprecated and replaced by `Jelix\Database\Helpers`
- `jDaoDbMapper::createTableFromDao()` returns an object `\Jelix\Database\Schema\TableInterface` instead of `jTable`

Plugins for jDb (aka "drivers"), implementing connectors etc, are not supported
anymore.

All error messages are now only in english. No more `jelix~db.*` locales.

## changes in jDao

jDao is now relying on [JelixDao](https://github.com/jelix/JelixDao).
The `jDao` class is still the main class to use to load and use Dao.
Some internal classes are gone.

  `\Jelix\Dao\DaoConditions` and `\Jelix\Dao\DaoCondition`.

New classes:

- `jDaoContext`
